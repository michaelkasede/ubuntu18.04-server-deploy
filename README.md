# ubuntu18.04 Server Deployment
Configurations required to prepare Ubuntu Core for a server deployment

Using Ubuntu 18.04 to test and deploy server ready environment can be very downting given that it is a very slim operating system (OS)  but I have been using in my test lab for quite some time now and I want to share the basic configurations I have to do to get a fresh installation ready for any production workloads.
